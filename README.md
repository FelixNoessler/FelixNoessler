### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m a doctoral student in ecological modelling at the [Theoretical Ecology](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/arbeitsgruppen/botanik/ag_tietjen/index.html) working group at the FU Berlin ([my webpage](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/arbeitsgruppen/botanik/ag_tietjen/People/doktoranden/Noessler/index.html)).
- 🌍 I’m currently working on the development of a grassland metacommunity model to better inform decisions for more sustainable use (see [RegionalGrasslandSim.jl](https://github.com/FelixNoessler/RegionalGrasslandSim.jl)).
- 🔭 I worked on food chain modelling with differential equations during my master thesis at the working group [Ecology and Ecosystem Modelling](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ibb-ecology/overview) at the University of Potsdam.
- I learned `Julia` during my master thesis and really like the ✨ [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) plotting ecosystem!
