### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a doctoral student in ecological modelling at the [Theoretical Ecology](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/arbeitsgruppen/botanik/ag_tietjen/index.html) working group at the FU Berlin ([my webpage](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/arbeitsgruppen/botanik/ag_tietjen/People/doktoranden/Noessler/index.html)).
- ðŸ”­ I worked on food chain modelling with differential equations during my master thesis at the working group [Ecology and Ecosystem Modelling](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ibb-ecology/overview) at the University of Potsdam.
- I learned Julia during my master thesis and really like the âœ¨ [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) plotting ecosystem!
